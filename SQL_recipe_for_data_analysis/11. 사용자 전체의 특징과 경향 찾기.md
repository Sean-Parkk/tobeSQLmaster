# 11. 사용자 전체의 특징과 경향 찾기
> 사용자의 서비스 사용 행동 분석, 고객 분류 분석 등

## 새로 알게된 것
### NTILE
* NTILE(n) OVER (ORDER BY COL) AS DECILE
	* COL을 윈도우 기준으로 n개의 그룹으로 묶어줌
		* 연속형 데이터에 대해 도수분포 BINS로 나눠준다고 생각하면 쉬움
* DECILE 분석
	* 누계매출액 등으로 등급을 나눠서 고객 분류
* RFM분석
	* 고객을 3가지 관점으로 나눠서 분석
		* Recency:  최근 구매일
		* Frequency: 구매 횟수
		* Monetary: 구매 금액 합계
	* 신규, 우량, 안정, 이탈 고객 등으로 나눠서 살펴볼 수 있음.
